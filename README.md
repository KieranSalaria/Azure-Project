# Azure-Project

A collection of hands‑on labs, research tasks, and cloud‑focused exercises completed as part of the Data Technician – Week 5 training programme.
This repository showcases practical experience with Microsoft Azure, cloud concepts, data governance, and SQL‑based data analysis.

## What I Learned
### Cloud Fundamentals
* Real‑world applications of cloud computing such as storage, collaboration, and remote access
* Business benefits of cloud adoption including scalability, cost‑efficiency, and reduced hardware maintenance
* Cloud service models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS — definitions, use cases, and differences
* Cloud deployment models: Public, Private, Hybrid, Community
* Azure pricing and cost estimation using the Azure Pricing Calculator

### Azure Architecture & Services
* Azure SQL Database: creating, querying, and managing relational data
* Azure Storage options including Blob Storage and SQL Database
* Azure Data Factory for data integration and automation
* Azure Synapse Analytics for large‑scale analytics
* Non‑relational data in Azure and how it differs from relational storage
* Microsoft Fabric Data Factory end‑to‑end data pipeline concepts

### Data Governance & Legislation
* GDPR principles and how they apply to customer data
* Data Protection Act 2018 and employer responsibilities
* Computer Misuse Act 1990 and Police & Justice Act 2006
* Copyright and intellectual property laws
* Employer data rights and employee permissions

### SQL & Data Analysis (AdventureWorks)
* Filtering and pattern matching using LIKE
* Aggregation: AVG, COUNT, SUM
* Joins: combining tables for richer insights
* Profit margin calculations using list price vs. standard cost
* Category‑level analytics: product counts, average prices
* Customer and order reporting
* Identifying premium products using cross joins and averages

## Key Skills Developed
* Cloud solution evaluation — choosing the right model (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS) for business needs
* Cost estimation and budgeting using Azure tools
* Understanding cloud security and compliance
* Writing SQL queries for real business scenarios
* Data modelling and structuring datasets for analytics
* Working with Azure data services in hands‑on labs
* Analysing relational and non‑relational data
* Interpreting UK data laws and applying them to cloud solutions
* Collaborating in cloud‑based environments

### Project Themes in This Repository
* Cloud research tasks
* Azure SQL Database labs
* Data Factory and Fabric pipeline exercises
* SQL analytics using AdventureWorks
* Cloud governance and compliance write‑ups
* Scenario‑based cloud architecture recommendations

### Overall Takeaways
* Cloud computing is not just storage — it’s a scalable, secure, cost‑efficient ecosystem for modern businesses.
* Azure provides a rich set of tools for data storage, transformation, and analytics.
* Understanding data laws is essential when designing cloud solutions.
* SQL remains a core skill for analysing business data and supporting decision‑making.

Hands‑on labs build confidence in navigating Azure services and applying them to real‑world scenarios.
